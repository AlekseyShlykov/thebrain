# Thebrain

A Next.js brain quiz game (static export for GitHub Pages).

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

**If the live site shows this README instead of the app**, the Pages source is wrong.

1. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not “Deploy from a branch”).
3. Push to `main` (or run the “Deploy to GitHub Pages” workflow manually). The workflow builds the app and deploys the `out/` folder.
4. Open the app at: **`https://<your-username>.github.io/brain-game/`** (trailing slash and `/brain-game/` path matter).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
